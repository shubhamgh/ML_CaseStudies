# Machine Learning Case Studies
Different case studies completed during ML subject curriculum:
1. Cancer Prediction- during this case study I created a simple machine learning model which predicted the possibility of cancer in an indivisual.
2. Titanic Survival Prediction- model that judges the chances of survival of indivisuals during the Titanic disaster.
3. Handwriten digits analysis- using SVM model classified handwritten digits from 0 to 9 based on pixel values given as features.
4. Classificaltion Model by Decision Tree- Working of decision tree and manipulating various hyperparameters.
5. K-Means Clusturing- Understood the working of K-Means clustering and building a model on it.
